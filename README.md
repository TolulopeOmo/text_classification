# text_classification


This notebook aims to give you a brief overview of performing text classification using Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines. We will be using a dataset called "Economic news article tone and relevance" from figure- eight which consists of approximately 8000 news articles, which were tagged as relevant or not relevant to the US Economy. Our goal in this notebook is to explore the process of training and testing text classifiers for this problem, using this data set and two text classification algorithms: Multinomial Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression, implemented in sklearn.
